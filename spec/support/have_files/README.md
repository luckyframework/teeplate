## Notes

This shard has been inlined for spec use. The [original shard](https://github.com/mosop/have_files) has additional
support for other testing libraries that are not needed here. All of the code was originally written by [mosop](https://github.com/mosop)
and minimally updated to remove dependencies from this version of `teeplate`.
